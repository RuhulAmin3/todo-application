### Key Features:

1. user can add, edit, delete all the Task. Each task contain priority, complete or incomplete status.

2. I'm using local storage to store all the added tasks, ensuring that they remain available even after the page is refreshed.

3. user can filter tasks based on the priority and search by the task title.

4. user can see how many tasks are added and how many are complete and incomplete.

### Key Objectives:
